# Longest Common Subsequence

A longest common subsequence (LCS) is defined as the longest subsequence which is common in all given input sequences.


## Example

Input: S1 = “AGGTAB”, S2 = “GXTXAYB”
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest subsequence which is present in both strings is “GTAB”.

Input: S1 = “BD”, S2 = “ABCD”
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest subsequence which is present in both strings is “BD”.

## Description

In this project Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is solve with Dynamic Programming using Tabulation method. Also added feature to visualize the table.
